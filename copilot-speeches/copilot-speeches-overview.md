# Copilot Speeches Overview

## Overview

Copilot Speeches is a module simulating basic copilot speeches and announcements during the flight, like:

* V1, V-rotate, V2 speed announcements,
* Transition level/altitude passing,
* Flight level 100 passing.

However, you can adjust the module to do any other announcements you would like to have.

## Copilot Speeches in the App

In the app, speeches are defined in the XML file. The announcements are invoked automatically with respect to the current airplane state (e.g., altitude).

## What now?

* I need to know how to initialize and load the copilot speeches - go to Copilot Speeches Init.
* I need to know how to manage copilot speeches during the flights -> Copilot Speeches Run.
* I need to know how to set generic settings for the whole copilot speeches module -> go to Copilot Speeches Settings.
* I'd like to create my own or change existing copilot speeches -> go to Copilot Speeches XML File.
